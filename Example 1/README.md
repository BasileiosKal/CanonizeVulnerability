## First Example

The Holder has the credential,


    {
        "@context": [
            "http://schema.org/",
            "https://w3id.org/security/v2"
        ],
        "firstName": "Kaiya",
        "address": {
            "postalAddress": "6096"
        }
    }

The Holder wants to prove only their postal address (PO number) and keep their
first name secret. After receiving the derived credential, the Verifier will be 
able to unveil the Holders name.
