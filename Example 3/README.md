## Third Example

Similarly to Example 1, The Holder has the following credential,
containing their first name and postalAddress (PO number).

    {
        "@context": [
            "http://schema.org/",
            "https://w3id.org/security/v2"
        ],
        "firstName": "Kaiya",
        "address": {
            "postalAddress": "2513"
        }
    }

In this scenario, they want to disclose only their first name and keep PO number name secret. 

After receiving the derived credential, the Verifier will be able to unveil the Holder's 
postal address (PO number).
