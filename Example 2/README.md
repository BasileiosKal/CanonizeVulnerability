## Second Example

The Holder has the following credential, representing a receipt for two items,
with each item identified by a four-digit ID. 


    {
      "@context": [
        "http://schema.org/",
        "https://w3id.org/security/v2"
      ],
      "id": "https://issuer.com/credentials/123456",
      "item": [
        {"item_ID": "7663"},
        {"item_ID": "9997"}
      ]
    }

In this scenario, they want to prove only that they bought the second item (item_ID = 9997) without disclosing
the information that they bought the first item (item_ID = 7663). 

The Verifier will be able to find the item_ID of the first item, that the Holder tries to hide, using the
canonical blank node labels.
